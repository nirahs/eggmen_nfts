            There will be strictly no refunds or sales cancelation for any

          </p>

          <p className="point">
            (a) Price and liquidity of blockchain assets, including the NFTs,
            are extremely volatile and may be subject to fluctuations;
          </p>

          <p className="point">
            (b) Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could
            materially and adversely affect the NFTs;

            (c) Legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely
            affect the use, transfer, and value of the NFTs;

          <p className="point">
            (d) NFTs are not legal tender and are not backed by any government;

          <p className="point">
            (e) Transactions involving NFTs may be irreversible, and losses due
            to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable,

            addresses;
          </p>

          <p className="point">
            (f) The value of NFTs may be derived from the continued willingness
            of market participants to exchange fiat currency or digital assets
            for NFTs, and therefore the value of NFTs is subject to the
            potential for permanent or total loss of value should the market for
            NFTs disappear;
          </p>

          <p className="point">
            (g) NFTs are subject to the risk of fraud, counterfeiting, cyber
            attacks and other technological difficulties which may prevent
            access to or use of your NFTs.
